# Overview:
Aliven't Messager is a simple mod that sends a message in the chat every time a named mob dies or it's killed.
Do you wonder why your villager-based farm it's not working anymore? Do you have any pet mob that's not a Parrot, Wolf or Cat that you care for?
So that's a mod that may interest you. As it shows when a named mob dies, you will know when "Zombington III", the zombie that scares your Villagers in the farm dies and why it happened so you can replace it as soon as possible and make it so the next one don't suffer the same fate. It'll also inform when that friend kills "Bacon Jr." so you can plan your revenge or if "Mr. BamChoo" rolled out of its pen into the abyss so you know you had to make a better house for them and make a nice memorial with the items they dropped.


# Note:

* Current version is compatible with 24w09a and up but Lore Drops will not work


# Aliven't messages send to everyone in the server/world:

* All named mobs.
* All Villagers.
* Zombie Villagers in process of conversion.
* Zombie Villagers that used to be Villagers with trades.
* All mobs, if you set the Game rule to do so.
 

# Miscellaneous changes:

* Named Creepers show "blew up" aliven't message when they explode as an attack or by getting ignited with Flint and Steel.
* Zombie Villagers default names are composed by their profession followed by "(Zombie Villager)".
* Named mobs will drop items with their name as item lore.
* Removes the default messages sent to the log about aliven't villagers and custom-named mobs.
 

# Settings:

* allMobMessages: Gives aliven't messages for all mobs, instead of just ones with custom names. Defaults false.
* villagerMessages: Gives aliven't messages for all Villagers and Zombie Villagers with trades. Defaults true.
* loreDrops: Gives lore info for items dropped from named mobs. Defaults true.
* nameColour: The names of the mobs will appear with colour. Defaults false.
* speciesName: The aliven't message for named mobs will display their "species" between parenthesis. Defaults false.
* aliventMessageServerSpamRemover: Removes the near-retundant log message of aliven't villagers and custom-named mobs. Defaults true.


# Considerations:

* I recomend using ModMenu
* This mod is Server-side only. It'll work in single player but you'll need to ask the server owner or administrators to install it in order to receive the messages.
* This mod applies for every mob with a custom name, be it because a nametag was used or because some mod or datapack named them.
* You'll need to have Death Message on.
* Pretty sure it is compatible with any mod and any language, but mobs with species names between parenthesis will be shown in the server's language.
* I intend to add more features, but I don't have any new ideas.
* Suggestions I like and see fitting may be implemented as well.
* Yes, fish "drown". This is the message Minecraft gives for when they're out of the water for too long.

# Legal:

* You're free to add this mod to your modpack and distribute it. Telling me or making me a donation it's not necessary but it'll be appreciated.
* I don't intend to port it to Forge, feel free to look my source code and do it yourself. In this case, I want to be notified.
